# Writeup

Deployed at https://htn-challenge-ez.vercel.app/

1. 
When designing a UI, I don't hesistate to draw on inspiration. I immediately thought Luma's event page (https://lu.ma/home) would be a great design to strive towards.
Implementation wise, I wanted to avoid a situation where I'd have to override a lot of CSS in style tags to get the look I wanted.

At my last co-op, we used the MUI library, and I was familiar with customizing its components. Some other UI frameworks I considered were shadcn and Vuetify. Since MUI was
still fresh in my memory, I chose MUI.

I'm using Next+React for ease of deployment with Vercel, as well as the dynamic routing. I got experience with this on a previous group project [here](https://github.com/LukasMartini/poker-replay).
The rudimentary "authentication" hooks I'm using for this challenge were also reused from that project.

I encountered the typical problems with styling not going my way. I wanted a timeline beside the event cards, and turns out it is an experimental component.
The default timeline MUI gave me has gaps in between the dots and lines which I spent a while figuring out how to override. [link](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-timeline/)

When determining what styles I should apply, I use Inspect Element/Developer Console in my browser to see what my changes look like instantly. 

I'm particularly proud of /components/RelatedEvent.tsx, as I reused a lot of code to represent one more field that the API gives me.
Since the API accepts only one ID at a time initially bemoaned having to handle *n* related event API calls.
Of course, I was being foolish, and I could just set up these independent RelatedEvent components to each call the API on their own.
I've been writing too much synchronous code recently...

My additional functionality is dark mode, filtering by event type, and a more developed authentication system.

2. 
This website as it is already took a lot of time, and there are a lot of parts I think could be improved.

a. Documentation - I could have documented more. I hope that most of the code is self explanatory due to descriptive naming.

b. Login system - Cut a lot of corners here just to get this project to completion. Obviously, we shouldn't be 
storing plaintext passwords. I didn't spend much time designing the login modal.

c. Better HTTP client - I would probably use Tanstack Query instead of fetch if I had more time. Fetch is good here
but it isn't perfect in prod. I could be sending a lot of unnecessary requests to the API. Tanstack Query 
handles edge cases where the user cancels requests, and caching. 

d. Styling - I could spend hours choosing fonts, color schemes, and gradients. However, I was focused more on 
ensuring functionality.

e. Accessibility - I have not tested my website on a screen reader. In past co-ops, I would run the website through
VoiceOver on iOS to see if the screen reader would pick up any anomalies.
Tabbing through my website, it seems to scope everything in the correct order. 
The timeline design I chose might impact screen readers. A workaround for solving this would be to add hidden text that
screen readers narrate despite not scoping into the left hand side of the timeline.

f. Features to add - Search, it would be another .filter call chained onto my API resonse data. Being unable to visually identify 
time conflicts between events is also a shortcoming of my design that I would resolve given more time. Being able to RSVP to an event 
is also a good feature to add.

3. 
I liked how open ended this challenge was! My submission here isn't perfect, but I'm happy with how it turned out.
The event type filters for instance, would be more extensible if I separated it off into its own component.
I've found that no matter what frontend codebase I've touched, there's always room for improvement; something is always
better off being renamed or refactored a little.  


# Autogenerated Instructions Below
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
